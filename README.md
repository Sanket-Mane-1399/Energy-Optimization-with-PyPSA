# Energy Optimization with PyPSA

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate energy system optimization problems using **[PyPSA](https://pypsa.org/)** (Python for Power System Analysis).  
The notebooks progressively build from simple electricity market modeling to more advanced topics like capacity expansion and sector coupling.

## Repository Contents

1. **Simple_Electricity_Market.ipynb**  
   - Introduces the fundamentals of electricity market clearing using PyPSA.  
   - Demonstrates how supply, demand, and prices interact in a simplified market.

2. **Capacity Expansion Planning.ipynb**  
   - Explores long-term capacity expansion planning.  
   - Shows how investment decisions in generation technologies and transmission impact system costs and reliability.

3. **Sector Coupling.ipynb**  
   - Extends the capacity expansion planning framework by integrating multiple energy sectors (e.g., electricity, heating, transport).  
   - Highlights how cross-sector interactions influence overall system design and optimization.  
   - **Note:** This notebook builds on the **Capacity Expansion Planning** model.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to formulate energy optimization problems in PyPSA.  
- Explore electricity market clearing in a simplified system.  
- Learn how to perform capacity expansion planning for long-term investment decisions.  
- Analyze the role of sector coupling in integrated energy system design.
